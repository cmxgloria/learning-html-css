flexbox gives us complete control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes
Flexbox uses two types of boxes that we’ve never seen before: “flex containers” and “flex items”. The job of a flex container is to group a bunch of flex items together and define how they’re positioned.


Every HTML element that’s a direct child of a flex container is an “item"
