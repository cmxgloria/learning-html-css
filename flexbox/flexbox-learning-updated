flexbox gives us complete control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes
Flexbox uses two types of boxes that we’ve never seen before: “flex containers” and “flex items”. The job of a flex container is to group a bunch of flex items together and define how they’re positioned.


Every HTML element that’s a direct child of a flex container is an “item"

grouping flex items

cross-axis (vertical) alignment
The official specification calls this “cross-axis” alignment (we’ll see why in a moment), but for our purposes it might as well be called “vertical” alignment.
The available options for align-items is similar to justify-content:
center
flex-start   (top)
flex-end      (bottom)
stretch
baseline
sample:
.header-container {
  color: #5995DA;
  background-color: #D6E9FE;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.header {
  width: 900px;
  height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

wrapping flex items
Again, the corresponding CSS should be familiar from previous sections:

.photo-grid-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.photo-grid {
  width: 900px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

.photo-grid-item {
  border: 1px solid #fff;
 width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
}
how to fix it if the box stay outside
.photo-grid {
  width: 900px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;    /* Change this */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
